# Should I Go Skiing?
A life-changing app for indecisive powder enthusiasts that gives the correct answer, every time.

## What is this?
A revolutionary decision-making tool that helps you determine if today is a skiing day. Spoiler: it is.

## Why?
Because your boss doesn't understand "powder day" as a valid excuse.

## Is it a powder day, what do I do?
Stop reading documentation and get your answer now. The mountains are calling.

## How to Use
1. Open app
2. Click button
3. Receive validation for the decision you already made
4. Close laptop
5. Grab skis
6. Profit

## Local Development
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone should-i-go-skiing

# Install dependencies (or don't, living on the edge)
npm install  # while dreaming of powder

# Run locally
npm run dev  # but why develop when you could be skiing?
```

## Deployment
- Deployed when I felt like it
- Will be maintained when I'm not skiing
- Uptime directly correlates with snowfall (inversely)

## Tech Stack
- Rainy day thoughts
- Lo-fi beats to ski/chill to
- Lukewarm coffee in a chipped mug
- Tears of joy when the forecast says 12+ inches

## Tech Decisions
- Next.js because it's fast (like my skiing... in my dreams)
- Interactive snowflakes because PRIORITIES
- No boring corporate logos because we're not LinkedIn

## Vibe Stack
- North face jacket
- Hot chocolate
- That feeling when you hit perfect powder
- No meetings in sight

## Known Issues
- Sometimes tells you to go skiing when you have "important meetings"
- Doesn't care about your deadlines
- May cause spontaneous PTO requests
- Highly addictive

## Roadmap
- None. App is perfect.
- Maybe snow animations (done because priorities)
- Will add features when the snow melts. So... never?

## Contributing
Don't. Go skiing instead.

But if you must:
1. Fix bug
2. No tests (we trust you)
3. Submit PR from chairlift

## License
Free as in freedom, free as in beer, free as in "free yourself from the chains of office work and hit the slopes."
